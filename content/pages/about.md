### Staff DevOps Engineer & Full-Stack Technologist

I’m a Staff DevOps Engineer with over 17 years of experience designing, building, and maintaining enterprise-scale software and infrastructure. My focus is on AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, and automation pipelines, and I love working across the full stack — from backend services in Go, Python, and Ruby to frontend applications built with React.

Over the years, I’ve worked in infrastructure engineering, systems administration, and full-stack development, leading large-scale AWS migrations and helping shape DevSecOps culture at Ad Hoc. I’m passionate about creating self-service DevOps platforms, improving observability, and driving reliability through blameless postmortems, chaos engineering, and strong operational practices.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me in a fantasy sports league, rooting for the LA Dodgers, Sacramento Kings, Las Vegas Raiders, or coaching youth baseball, football, and basketball. I’m all about building systems — whether it’s in the cloud or on the field.
