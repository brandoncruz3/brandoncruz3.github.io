Yesterday’s (10/20/25) AWS outage got a lot of folks thinking. We all knew this could happen — yet somehow, everyone was still surprised when it did.

What stood out most to me was how quickly the conversations shifted to “spin up a new region,” even though for most teams, that process takes longer than just waiting out the outage. Isn’t that exactly what Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) are supposed to account for?

A business continuity plan isn’t for when something you rely on is down for a day. It’s for when a service you depend on is retiring tomorrow — or when the entirety of us-east-1 is literally on fire and unrecoverable. That’s a powerful distinction. BCPs aren’t meant to solve every minor disruption. They’re about survivability — what happens when the infrastructure you depend on becomes permanently unavailable.

At the same time, these “short outages” aren’t exactly rare. We treat them as edge cases, but they happen often enough to expose how few organizations are truly prepared for a catastrophic failure.

Many of us engineers know all too well: If your service must stay up through a region failure, you have to design for that — multi-region failover, hot spares, regular drills. But that reliability comes with exponentially higher cost. The trade-off isn’t always worth it versus a single day of downtime.

Ultimately, it’s a reminder that resilience isn’t binary. You have to decide what level of reliability your business truly needs — and what level of complexity and spend you’re willing to accept to get there.

And that’s where the heart of the matter lies — risk management.

What is the probability that your infrastructure will fail, and what will the impact be when it does? You can implement controls to limit that risk — auto-failover to another region, multi-cloud redundancy, or automated recovery mechanisms — but each layer of protection increases complexity and cost.

Achieving more “nines” of availability means exponential investment. Even the big three hyperscalers fail from time to time, despite their deep pockets. Fully mitigating all risk is impossible — the real challenge is finding the right balance between residual risk and the additional cost required to reduce it.

💡 Takeaway:
Control what you can control. Design and build for graceful degradation, use queues and backoff strategies, automate recovery. Don’t chase zero downtime — aim for predictable recovery and operational resilience.
