Recently, I discovered a note-taking tool called Obsidian, which has proven to be a straightforward and convenient way to capture my thoughts and ideas. While I don’t always need to take notes, I sometimes feel the urge to jot down something important. Obsidian makes this effortless by offering a simple structure: your files, a versatile editor available on multiple platforms, and an array of plugins to customize your workflow. Best of all, you’re free to decide how to use it.

Around the same time, I faced similar frustrations with my website. Most WYSIWYG editors felt clunky, and the entirely web-based approach needed proper autosave functionality during the writing process. This meant I had to draft content in one tool, then transfer and edit it elsewhere to ensure it looked polished. While these issues are solvable, I found it more rewarding to focus on creating content rather than wrestling with the tools.

Using Obsidian made me wonder how great it would be if I could write website articles just as seamlessly. That curiosity led me to discover Hugo, a static site generator, and I decided to integrate the two tools to create a streamlined and enjoyable writing experience.
